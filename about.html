            <h4>More About Us.</h4>
            <p>The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay is a home to some of the brightest and most aware young technical minds of India. It is these minds that will carry the country in the next century and the question of energy is undoubtedly one of the largest questions they will have to address. </p>
            <p>Consequently, there are many students on campus highly conscious and concerned about the future of energy and sustainability. However, such students are separated by virtue of belonging to different disciplines and years.</p>
            <p>It is the need for a common platform for such students to come together and turn their concern into action, which brought the Energy Club into existence. A group of energy conscious students with the backing of the faculty decided to start a formal Club that would make energy awareness and action itâ€™s priority and combine the ideas and concern of students across campus into tangible steps towards energy and sustainability.</p>
